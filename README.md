Ecommerce Project - Data Analysis and Sales Insights
This project involves analyzing ecommerce data to derive actionable insights related to sales, customer behavior, and product performance. The analysis leverages tools such as SQL, Python, and Excel to explore the dataset and perform regression analysis for predictive modeling.

Project Overview
The project focuses on performing basic, intermediate, and advanced data analysis using SQL and Python libraries. The insights generated from the analysis include:

Sales trends over time
Customer segmentation
Revenue analysis by product category
Key metrics such as retention rates, moving averages, and growth rates
The project also applies supervised regression machine learning models to identify key relationships between various factors like product prices and purchase frequency.

Key Features
